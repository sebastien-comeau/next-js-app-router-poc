Uhhhh.....  https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/58699   
RIP???


Realistically though: either accept there needs to be a 'hacky' solution in whatever framework you want to use,
or use Next 12 where this feature was supported.  I maintain that this is a low probability bad UX event
and not the end of the world that would necessarily rule out Next 14 with app router on its own.
